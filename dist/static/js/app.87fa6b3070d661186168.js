Perhaps it will be helped by giant panda and bamboo habitat conservation efforts. ",AltText:"Perched on a leafy hillside, this medium sized creature is a greyish brown color. It has four legs, a short tail folded close to a white rump, and mouse-like ears that seem too big for its head. A patch of dark fur on the top of its head gives it its name."},{ImageName:"leopardcat2.jpg",EntityName:"Leopard cat",EntityDescription:"The population of Leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis) is declining, mainly due to loss of habitat. Restoring bamboo forests saves these animals, too.",AltText:"Like the much larger predator with whom it shares its name, this animal has dark marks, commonly spots or rosettes.
